# bingsearcher

Search Bing 30 times in a row. Use by searching something on Bing once manually so that you are on the search results page, and then activating the extension and clicking the "Start searching" button.

One might also, for no particular reason, try opening a private browser window (or otherwise clearing cookies), opening the inspector and changing the user-agent to one immitating a mobile device, and then following through with the steps above. The result would be that it would appear that the searches are coming from a mobile device; of course, there is no reason why someone would want to do that in particular, it's just neat!
